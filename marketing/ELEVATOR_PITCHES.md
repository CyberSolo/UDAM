## 60-Second Version (Investors/Business)

"Data is valuable, but selling it is complicated. You need payment processing, secure access control, and complex infrastructure before you can even start.

UDAM solves this. It's an open-source marketplace platform that handles all the technical complexity - Stripe payments, AES-256 encryption, concurrency control, session management. 

Developers can launch a data marketplace in 5 minutes instead of 6 weeks. Whether you're selling API access, datasets, or AI models, UDAM provides the foundation.

It's MIT licensed, production-tested, and already running on GitHub. We're building a community of contributors and we're looking to expand the ecosystem with plugins and templates.

Think of it as Shopify for data services."

## 90-Second Version (Pitch Competition)

"The data economy is exploding. Companies want to monetize their APIs and datasets, but building a marketplace is incredibly complex.

Let me show you: to sell data services, you need payment processing, secure token management, access control, race condition handling, and regulatory compliance. That's 4-6 weeks of development - and you haven't even started on your actual product.

We built UDAM to solve this. It's an open-source marketplace backend that provides everything you need: Stripe integration, AES-256 encryption, PostgreSQL with concurrency control, session management, and full CI/CD testing.

Here's how it works: [show quick demo or diagram]
1. Fork the repo
2. Configure your environment (5 minutes)
3. Start selling your data services

Real-world use cases:
- API marketplaces like RapidAPI
- Research data exchanges
- AI model access platforms
- IoT data trading

The business model is open-source first, then enterprise features: white-labeling, advanced analytics, compliance tools, priority support.

We've already got traction on GitHub with [X] stars in [Y] weeks. The developer community is hungry for this - every marketplace reinvents the same wheel.

Our ask: We're looking for [investment/partnerships/contributors] to build out the enterprise tier and grow the ecosystem.

UDAM: The infrastructure layer for the data economy."
